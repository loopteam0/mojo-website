            <span id="text-rg">Born out of a personal experience in the heart of Lebanon, Mojo emerged
                as more than just a mobile wallet—it's a beacon of hope, bringing
                financial freedom and innovation to the Lebanese people. In 2021, a
                couple of our co-founders found themselves in a predicament, unable to
                pay for a dinner during their Lebanese holiday due to the limitations of
                the prevailing financial situation. This singular event, not only
                highlighted an everyday problem but also ignited a passion to develop a
                solution. With over a decade of fintech expertise across Africa, we
                channelled our insights and commitment into creating Mojo; a platform
                designed to serve the greater good of Lebanon, redfining the future of
                finance in Lebanon. Our mission is to provide a secure, efficient,
                flexible, and affordable wallet for every citizen, making daily
                transactions—from buying groceries to settling utility bills—a seamless
                experience. Moreover, Mojo aims to reintegrate the Lebanese community
                into the global financial ecosystem, rectifying the exclusion we faced
                post 17 October Revoltuion. Together, we mark this Anniversary by
                introducting Mojo on this significate date. Let us regain our financial
                freedom, let’s empower Lebanon once again, let’s get our Mojo on!</span>
